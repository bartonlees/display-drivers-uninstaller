Hi guys.


(IMPORTANT :  GOOGLE CODE IS CLOSING, HERE MY NEW GITHUB REPOSITORY :


https://github.com/Wagnard/display-drivers-uninstaller)

Today I'm presenting a Driver Uninstaller (DDU) / Cleaner made for Display Drivers.(NVIDIA/AMD)


Whats it does is removing the Display driver from device manager and removing the current and all precedent driver from the Windows Driver store along with removing services from NVIDIA/AMD.

The current effect after you use this tool will be similar as if Windows was in a "Fresh Install" state.

This tool act similar to what Driver sweeper do + the extra mentioned above.

If you have problem installing older driver or newer one, give it a try as there are some reports that it fix those problems.

RECOMMENDED USAGE :

-The tool can be used in Normal mode but for abolute stability when using DDU, Safemode is always the best.

- I would like to gather feedback from you guys. Tell me if it was success or not.
make a backup or a system restore (but it should normally be pretty safe).

-For people with driver problem, if this tool gave you any success into fixing some issues your are currently experiencing, please share your result.


Keep note that NVIDIA/AMD did not have anything to do with this, I do not work at or for NVIDIA/AMD and they should not be held responsible for anything that may go wrong with this application.
